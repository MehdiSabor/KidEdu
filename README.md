#  Server-Side REST API Overview
this is the class project's 2nd milestone repository, showcasing a server-side solution crafted with Node.js, implementing RESTful API leveraging principles we've learned in class. My focus has been on efficient practices and security. we've integrated robust middleware for user authentication, employing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and rigorous authorization checks to protect our endpoints.
In addition to a streamlined codebase, this repository contains a suite of tests, providing a demonstration of our approach to validating functionality and security.
