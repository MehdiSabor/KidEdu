#  Server-Side REST API Overview
this is the class project's 2nd milestone repository, showcasing a server-side solution crafted with Node.js, implementing RESTful API leveraging principles we've learned in class. My focus has been on efficient practices and security. we've integrated robust middleware for user authentication, employing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and rigorous authorization checks to protect our endpoints.
In addition to a streamlined codebase, this repository contains a suite of tests, providing a demonstration of our approach to validating functionality and security. 

#  Client-Side React Native Overview

this is the client-side segment of our class project's 3rd milestone, which complements the server-side solution crafted with Node.js. This React Native mobile application connects with the RESTful API, emphasizing efficient practices and security, mirroring changes made on the server side. We've implemented robust user authentication with JWT and thorough authorization checks for enhanced endpoint protection. The app is integrated with ngrok, enabling real-time server communication for a dynamic testing experience. For security reasons, access is limited to pre-authorized email addresses. This repository not only showcases the client-side interface but also reflects updates made on the server side, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.
